# Travel Destination Discovery Platform

A comprehensive web application that helps users discover, review, and share travel destinations. Users can explore locations, read community reviews, and share their own travel experiences through an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

## üåü Project Overview

This project was born from identifying a real-world problem: travelers often struggle to find suitable destinations due to scattered information, lack of transparent reviews, and inability to filter based on personal preferences. To address these challenges, I developed a full-stack web application that allows users to share experiences, provide direct reviews, and save favorite destinations.

Through building this platform, I enhanced my full-stack development skills including database design, API development, UX/UI design, and interactive functionality implementation. This project taught me the importance of understanding real user needs to build valuable and practical applications.
